=== "Overview"
    The Fortify Plugin for Eclipse, included with the Fortify SCA installer, consists of three separate plugin components:

    **Audit** – Enables you to open existing scan results and audit them. These results include detailed descriptions of the security vulnerabilities detected and recommended remediation strategies. The audit plugin component helps security code inspection by enabling you to easily navigate to the source code location associated with each vulnerability, and then prioritize and audit the results.
    
    **Analysis** – Enables you to initiate a Micro Focus Fortify Static Code Analyzer scan and analysis with Fortify security content, view the results, and fix the code associated with uncovered issues, all within the Eclipse IDE.
    
    **Collaboration** – Includes server‑related functionality such as connecting to Micro Focus Fortify Software Security Center, uploading results to Fortify Software Security Center, and performing collaborative audits. (If you do not want this functionality, then there is no need to install the collaboration plugin.)
    Note: For information about supported versions of Eclipse, see the Micro Focus Fortify Software System Requirements document

=== "Overview"

    With the Fortify Extension for Visual Studio Code you have three ways to scan your project for security vulnerabilities.

    Run a locally installed version of Fortify Static Code analyzer on the currently opened project to create an FPR. Open the FPR in Fortify Audit Workbench to view the results.
    Run a remote translation and scan using Fortify ScanCentral. You can upload the results to Fortify Software Security Center.
    Upload your project to Fortify on Demand for assessment.
    Run extension
    To run the extension, do one of the following:

    Click the Fortify icon in the Activity Bar.

    Select View > Command Palette and type “fortify"
