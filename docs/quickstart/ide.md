The Fortify extension for Visual Studio Code is a tool that allows developers to easily integrate security testing into their development workflow. It provides an easy-to-use interface for running scans on their code using Micro Focus Fortify, a leading application security testing tool.

The extension provides a variety of scan options, including the ability to run scans locally using the Fortify Audit Workbench or remotely using Fortify on Demand or Fortify Software Security Center.

By providing an easy way to integrate security testing into the development process, the Fortify extension for Visual Studio Code helps developers build more secure code and reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities in their applications.
