**SSC** is a centralized web interface that maintains scan results (SAST, DAST, OSS).  Developers and Security can utilize this portal to work together to find, fix, and remediate security vulnerabilities across the application stack. Customized templates and integration with Audit Assist allow for fine turning of scan results.  A robust API can be used to interact with the platform, including pulling vulnerability information.
