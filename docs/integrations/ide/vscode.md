# Overview
With the Fortify Extension for Visual Studio Code you have three ways to scan your project for security vulnerabilities.

- Run a locally installed version of Fortify Static Code analyzer on the currently opened project to create an FPR. Open the FPR in Fortify Audit Workbench to view the results.

- Run a remote translation and scan using Fortify ScanCentral. You can upload the results to Fortify Software Security Center.

- Upload your project to Fortify on Demand for assessment.
