# Fortify OnPremise

## SAST Components

**Software Security Center (SSC)** is a centralized platform that provides an end-to-end solution for managing application security. It integrates with Fortify Static Code Analyzer and other security tools to provide a comprehensive view of an organization's application security posture. The platform includes features such as security assessment management, remediation tracking, and reporting, to help organizations manage the entire application security process, from identifying vulnerabilities to resolving them. It also provides a collaborative environment for security and development teams to work together to improve the security of applications


**Static Code Analyzer** is a software tool that performs automated analysis of source code to identify security vulnerabilities. It uses a combination of code analysis and data flow algorithms to detect potential security issues and provide actionable remediation guidance to developers. The tool supports a variety of programming languages and can be integrated into the software development process to catch vulnerabilities early, improving the overall security of the final product.

**Scan Central SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** is a component of the Fortify Software Security Center platform that provides centralized management and reporting for static code analysis scans. It allows organizations to automate the scan process, schedule scans, and generate reports on the results, all in a single platform. The goal of Fortify Scan Central SAST is to simplify the process of performing and managing SAST scans and provide a clear view of an organization's application security posture. It helps organizations identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities, and provides actionable remediation guidance to developers to help them quickly resolve the issues.

**WebInspect** is a dynamic application security testing (DAST) tool that scans web applications for vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and other common security issues. It works by sending requests to a web application and analyzing the responses to identify potential security risks. Unlike static code analysis, which only analyzes the code, WebInspect tests the application in its actual runtime environment, providing a more comprehensive view of the application's security posture. The tool integrates with the Fortify Software Security Center platform to provide centralized management and reporting for DAST scans and to give organizations a complete picture of their application security.

**Scan Central DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** is a component of the Fortify Software Security Center platform that provides centralized management and reporting for dynamic security scans of web applications. It automates the process of performing DAST scans, allowing organizations to schedule scans and generate reports on the results. The goal of Fortify Scan Central DAST is to simplify the process of performing and managing DAST scans and provide a clear view of an organization's web application security posture. It helps organizations identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities, and provides actionable remediation guidance to developers to help them quickly resolve the issues. By integrating with Fortify WebInspect, Fortify Scan Central DAST provides a comprehensive view of the security of an organization's web applications.
